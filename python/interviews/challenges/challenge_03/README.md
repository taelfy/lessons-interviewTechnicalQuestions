 # Forecasting Technical Challenge

# Objective

The Company has engaged the Advanced Analytics team to forecast total beer market (Company + competitors) for NSW across both the tap and pack market. The forecast has to be monthly volume for the next 12 months. 

Legend:
- Tap = On premise e.g. pubs
- Pack = Off premise e.g. Bottleshops such as Dan Murphy etc

# Context

The output from this model will be compared to the Company’s volume projection created by the sales team to highlight any risk and/or opportunities that the Leadership team needs to be aware of. This will be presented at the Demand Review forum which is held monthly and attended by the leadership team.  

# Your Task
- Create an output using Python 
- Prepare a short presentation deck. Some considerations to include in your presentation:
    - Approach and process in tackling this task with Richard to get to a good business outcome?
    - Methodology and assumptions in creating this forecast? (e.g. data sources you would consider and any industry specific nuances)
    - Output from your analysis
    - Anything else you feel is needed so that this deck is suitable to be used as a presentation with the stakeholder 

Note: Please feel free to reach out and ask any questions you may have. We are also comfortable for you to make any logical assumptions as necessary. 

# Guidance

For context- we’re not looking for a super polished presentation deck. We’re interested in understanding your approach, thought process, and ability to formulate ideas/business cases to present to senior stakeholders. Enjoy yourself- we’re glad to have you along ☺
